This project delves into the evolution of cinema to explore whether a “Golden Age” has existed and to identify the key factors that define success across eras. By analyzing historical and contemporary trends in film production, genre popularity, and global appeal, we aim to uncover patterns that reflect shifts in cinematic influence and cultural resonance over time. Our approach considers both the artistic and economic dimensions of the film industry, examining how certain genres, themes, and regions rise to prominence and shape cinematic eras. Ultimately, we seek to understand where the current landscape fits within cinema’s broader history and what trends may lie ahead. Through data-driven insights, we hope to tell a compelling story of cinema’s dynamic journey and its role in reflecting and shaping society across decades.
